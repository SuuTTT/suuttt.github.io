Two years ago OpenAI's hide-and-seek agents made a great story: pour agents
into a physics sandbox, let them compete, and watch distinct strategies
*emerge* in sharp phase transitions — box-blocking, ramp use, box-surfing.
I wanted to know what the same recipe looks like on **Boom**, a
Clash-Royale-like lane battler I run as a generational self-play league. This
is an honest account of what I found. It is less cinematic than hide-and-seek,
and the reasons why are the interesting part.

## The setup

Boom is a deterministic JAX game: two players, elixir economy, cards, towers,
three-minute matches. The league is simple generational self-play with gates.
Every ~21 GPU-minutes a **candidate** trains against a pool of past selves,
then it must beat the reigning **champion** over seat-swapped paired matches
with the **lower bound of a 95% confidence interval above 50%** to be
promoted. No CI-clearance, no crown. Every generation is also measured against
two fixed yardsticks — a `random` bot and a scripted `rule_v0` bot — so there
is always a stationary reference.

The twist, which turned out to define everything: **the game kept changing
under the league.** Over the campaign the engine advanced from v8 to v15 as I
chased Clash-Royale mechanics parity — spell flight, charge, building knockback
immunity, a tangential-slide pathing fix, the walk-retarget kiting rule,
king-tower activation, pull spells. The league was never reset. It *resumed
and adapted* across every one of those changes.

## The progression curve is honest, and noisy

Here is win rate against the two fixed anchors across all 217 generations.
Two things jump out. First, `random` (green) saturates near 100% almost
immediately — it is too weak to be a useful yardstick past gen 5. Second,
`rule_v0` (pink) climbs from ~70% to a plateau around 85%, with a visible step
up around **gen 69** — but it is *noisy and non-monotonic*, dipping to 50% at
points and never becoming a clean upward sweep.

That noise is not a plotting artifact. It is the honest fingerprint of a
**moving target**: each engine change shifted what "good play" means, and the
scripted bot's relative strength moved with it. Explorer generations, which
deliberately play off-policy to find new strategies, add the sharp downward
spikes. If you came expecting the tidy sigmoid of a stationary benchmark, this
is the correction — real training against a changing game and a changing
opponent pool looks like *this*.

## The clean signal is transitivity

Anchor curves are muddy. The sharper question is: **is a later champion
actually better than an earlier one?** I played the current champion
(generation 192) against four of its ancestors, 64 seat-swapped matches each.

![Champion win rate versus ancestor generations, a monotonic gradient](/images/league/league_transitivity.png)

This is the result I am most confident in. The champion beats the ancient
generation-5 policy **80%** of the time, generation 30 **70%**, generation 69
**61%**, and the champion it directly dethroned, generation 166, **55%** — a
clean monotonic gradient. Newer beats older, and it beats *older* older more
decisively. That is exactly the shape genuine, incremental progress should
have. It also tells you the gains are **marginal per step**: promotion gates
cleared at roughly 57%, and 55% over the immediately-prior champion is real
but small. There is no capability explosion here — there is a ladder, climbed
one careful rung at a time.

Here is the champion closing out a match against its gen-5 ancestor (blue =
champion, red = ancestor; it wins by razing the enemy king tower):

## Two findings I did not go looking for

**Non-transitivity is mostly absent — but not entirely.** In individual matches
the champion occasionally *loses* to gen 5 (I caught one on the first seed I
tried). Over 64 matches that washes out to a clean 80%, but the existence of
rock-paper-scissors pockets is real, and it is a known reason self-play ladders
can stall.

**A large, consistent seat asymmetry.** The champion wins **94–100% as player
2** but only **28–59% as player 1** against the same ancestors. The promotion
gates are seat-swapped, so the ladder itself is fair — but the raw asymmetry
says Boom has a substantial second-player advantage (or the league specialized
to one seat), and it is big enough that any un-swapped evaluation would be
badly misleading. I only saw it because I always swap seats.

## Why this is less dramatic than hide-and-seek — honestly

Hide-and-seek had two things Boom does not. Its environment was *open-ended* (a
physics sandbox where a genuinely new tool — a ramp, a box — unlocks a new
regime), and it was *stationary* (the rules never moved, so a phase transition
is unmistakable against a fixed backdrop). Boom is a tightly constrained card
game with a fixed action space, and I deliberately kept changing its rules to
chase parity. Under those conditions you should *expect* gradual refinement and
constant re-adaptation, not sharp emergent phase transitions — and that is what
I measured. I cannot honestly claim "the league discovered kiting at gen 166
because I added kiting at v15." What I can claim is narrower and true: the last
two champions were the first trained in the v15-mechanics era, the ladder kept
climbing across five engine changes without a reset, and each rung is a
CI-verified improvement over the last.

## Takeaways

- **Self-play across a moving game works.** The league adapted through v8→v15
  with no resets and kept producing verified champions (30 → 69 → 166 → 192).
- **Trust transitivity over anchor curves** when the game is non-stationary; the
  anchors move, head-to-head does not.
- **Always swap seats.** The 94%-vs-28% split would have turned any single-seat
  number into fiction.
- **Emergence needs an open-ended, stationary world.** A constrained,
  deliberately-shifting one gives you honest, incremental, hard-won gains
  instead — which is still exactly what you want from a competition ladder.
